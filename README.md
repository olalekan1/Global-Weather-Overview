#### **Project Objective**
###### This project is to demonstrate the extraction and transformation of weather API data in order to provide insights into weather conditions across different country and continent

#### **Project Summary**
###### The project gave insights on countries experiencing high and low temperature, pressure and humidity with respect to the type of weather condition like, clear, cloudy, rainy, etc.

#### **Tools/Skills demonstrated**
###### Python, CSV, JSON, API, Web scraping, ETL, Power BI and Excel

#### **Data:**
Data extracted on: Thu 01th February, 2024 at 09:14:18AM UTC
###### **Data source 1:** *https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_continents*
###### Web scraping was performed to profile countries with their respective capital cities and continents

###### **Data source 2:** *https://openweathermap.org/*
###### Using API data, current weather information was extracted for capital cities of different country. You may visit https://openweathermap.org/current#fields_json for explanation about the fields.

#### **Project Limitations:**
###### **Historical data:** *Historical weather data was not made available for the free version of the API that was used in this project. Hence, the restriction to the current weather information which was extracted on Mon 29th January, 2024 at 11:12:14PM UTC.*
###### **Bulk data download:** *Bulk weather data download was not made available for the free version of the API that was used in this project. Hence, the made different API call for each location.*

#### **Project Requirements:**
###### * Which continent has the highest temperature, pressure and	humidity?
###### * Which continent has the lowest temperature, pressure and	humidity?
###### * Which country has the  highest temperature, pressure and	humidity?
###### * Which country has the  lowest temperature, pressure and	humidity?
###### * Which country has the highest wind speed, and what is the speed?
###### * Are there any country experiencing extreme weather conditions (e.g., very high or very low temperatures)?
###### * What is the most common type of weather condition (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy) for each continent?

#### **Suggested improvement**
###### * The outcome of the analysis may be compared with historical weather information in order to understand how the world has fared in the face of global warming conversation.
###### * Explore correlations between weather data and other environmental indicators.
